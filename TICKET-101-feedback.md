The code is well documented and easily readable

Functionally, everything works correctly.

No good reason for creditModifier to be a global variable.

validator is only used in the verifyInputs method, no reason for it to be a global variable.

What should have been documented is the way the program assigns the credit modifier to
personal codes based on the last 4 digits. As of now this mechanism has to be discovered
by inspecting the source code.

The method DecisionEngine.calculateApprovedLoan catches the exceptions thrown by verifyInputs
and proceeds with returning a decision with an error message, which is strange and bad for
several reasons. First of all exceptions should be handled in controller, not service.
Furthermore, the custom exceptions are in fact instances of class Throwable,
not Exception, thus are not going to be handled in the catch block for instances of class
Exception, therefore this try-catch block is redundant anyway. This also seems to be
the only case when the errorMessage field in the Decision class is assigned and used.
Therefore, this field is redundant and should be removed.

Custom exceptions should be instances of Exception, not just Throwable, otherwise they are
not regarded as exceptions.

Some test methods have incorrect names

Decision class could be a record

Tried to fix all of the above.
